## 🧭 Overview

**CoSaP** is a novel path planning algorithm designed to operate efficiently in **completely unknown environments**. It intelligently samples nodes in the space using cognitive based goal-biased heuristics, deriving potential field paths for local goal opted from sampled nodes in iteration until the goal is reached.

> 🚫 **Note**: The core pseudocode and implementation details are withheld due to current journal review. This repository provides validated results and context for review purposes only.

## 🎯 Key Highlights

- Efficient global path planner in both **unknown** and **known** environments
- Works without prior maps, compatible with SLAM/local planners like DWA
- Demonstrates better performance than classical planners; RRT, D* Lite, A*, Bug2 (As per the benchmark results) in:
  - ⏱️ Time to goal
  - 📏 Path optimality
  - 💾 Memory and computation cost

---

## 📊 Benchmark Results

This repository includes:

- 📈 Performance comparison graphs
- 🧪 Simulation snapshots from Matplotlib-based planner
- 🧮 Environment setups used for evaluation (grid maps)

Please see the [`/benchmark_results`](./benchmark_results) folder for plots and benchmark graphs.
